> Greedo: Jabba's through with you! He has no use for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
Han Solo: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
Greedo: You can tell that to Jabba. At best, he may only take your ship.  
Han Solo: Over my dead body!  
Greedo: That's the idea... I've been looking forward to this for a long time.  
Han Solo: Yeah, I'll bet you have.  
[Han blasts Greedo, then heads out, tossing the bartender a coin]  
Han Solo: Sorry about the mess.
